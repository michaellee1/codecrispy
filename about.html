                <p class="lead">I started programming in the 7th grade, only
                inspired to start coding by my brother, who majored in computer
                science. All throughout elementary and middle school, I had yet
                to see one class on computer programming, an essential skill
                that powers all of our technology. The very first opportunity 
                came in high school, which came with two Java classes.  Although 
                better than most high schools can muster, it is a classic "too 
                little too late."
                <br>
                <br>
                Even though I learned so comparatively early, I only really got 
                into it one and a half years after I had begun typing out my first lines of
                code. After finding an inner interest, a &ldquo;spark&rdquo;, and asking
                a few fellow high school coders I met at MIT about their 'spark', I
                realized that everyone who is a &ldquo;programmer&rdquo; had a
                certain revelation of sorts that really pushed them to where they are now. It
                is interest, and not experience, that creates this spark.
                <br>
                <br>
                For me and for many other coders, this spark was created when I
                finally realized what coding meant. It wasn&rsquo;t about
                knowing the syntax for lambda expressions or an AJAX call, it
                was finally realizing that your imagination could now be passed
                to the computer.
                <br>
                <br>
                Code Crispy&rsquo;s goal is to pass that same inspiration onto
                students who want to give programming a try. It does this
                through educating younger children, and through
                targeted donations.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our curriculum has a simple philosophy - Theory over syntax. I
                believe its more important for kids to understand what they can
                implement than exactly how its done. This means that younger
                elementary school children will see the theory behind more
                advanced notions, like scalable servers, multithreading,
                database pulls, and other great amazing things that can hook
                you in and really help to get kids thinking about what they can
                pull off. The syntax is always there to guide them and really
                get them used to reading in code, but its clearly far more
                important to be thinking &lsquo;It is possible, and I know the
                theory&rsquo; versus &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t possible for
                me.&rsquo;
                <br>
                <br>
                The money that we collect will be donated to other charities
                that have these values and ideals, in order to further our
                cause in a way we can&rsquo;t do ourselves. If you like our
                cause and want to help us out, the best way to do so is through
                a donation. Your money will go toward helping kids find their
                next opportunity.
